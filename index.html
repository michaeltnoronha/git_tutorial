			<h3>What is Git?</h3>
			<p>(More importantly, why should you care?)</p>
			<div class="gitexplaincontain">
				<div class="gitexplaindivs">
					<h3>
						An intuitive version control system
					</h3>
					<p>
						Beyond just assurance that your code is backed up at some location other than your own hard drive, using git means that it is possible to revert a repository to its state at any given commit. So long as you use git frequently, there is literally no single point of failure that could possibly occur.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, using git allows you to seamlessly manage and distinguish between different groups of code- what will be part of the final product, testing, and anything else that could be necessary.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="gitexplaindivs">
					<h3>
						A lightweight yet powerful tool that allows you to collaborate with others effectively
					</h3>
					<p>
						When working on group projects, it is natural for work to be divided up. Traditionally, certain snippets of code would be distributed to team members, however few individuals would actually hold the entire code. Using git, this problem no longer exists- each person from the team stores the entire repository on their computer, and branches can be created to effectively manage the contributions of different team members.
						No longer is there a need to worry about a server crash or other loss of data.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="gitexplaindivs">
					<h3>
						Access to a tremendous open source community
					</h3>
					<p>
						Unlike many other systems out there, git truly has no limit. As a free user, one is able to host an unlimited amount of pages on the web, as well as a limitless amount of public repositories. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The benefits of using git lie not only in the ability to host sites for free or store code online, but in the community of individuals who volunteer countless hours improving code for others. Via pull requests, organizations, and more, git (and github) allow you to enter into a collaborative and self-sustaining community.

						What is "the shell", and why does it matter?
					</h3>
					<p>
						Right now, as you have visited this website, you are interacting with your computer. Command line interface has largely been replaced by GUIs, however the command line remains a powerful tool that can be used to manage git and more.
					</p>
					<p class="shellextrapadding">
						To get started, you are going to want to go ahead and <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">download git</a>. Once you have finished, go ahead and open up <strong>Git Bash</strong>.

						What does cloning mean?
					</ch3>
					<p>
						When using Git, cloning refers to downloading the entire contents of a repository on to one's personal computer. Unlike other version control systems, Git allows you or anyone else who so desires to download the entire repository.
					</p>
					<p>
						This, of course, has several notable benefits. As Git is built around the idea of open source code, anyone in the world is able to clone a repository and help the owner fix mistakes and produce better products.
