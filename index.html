			<h3>What is Git?</h3>
			<p>(More importantly, why should you care?)</p>
			<div class="gitexplaincontain">
				<div class="gitexplaindivs">
					<h3>
						An intuitive version control system
					</h3>
					<p>
						Beyond just assurance that your code is backed up at some location other than your own hard drive, using git means that it is possible to revert a repository to its state at any given commit. So long as you use git frequently, there is literally no single point of failure that could possibly occur.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, using git allows you to seamlessly manage and distinguish between different groups of code- what will be part of the final product, testing, and anything else that could be necessary.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="gitexplaindivs">
					<h3>
						A lightweight yet powerful tool that allows you to collaborate with others effectively
					</h3>
					<p>
						When working on group projects, it is natural for work to be divided up. Traditionally, certain snippets of code would be distributed to team members, however few individuals would actually hold the entire code. Using git, this problem no longer exists- each person from the team stores the entire repository on their computer, and branches can be created to effectively manage the contributions of different team members.
						No longer is there a need to worry about a server crash or other loss of data.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="gitexplaindivs">
					<h3>
						Access to a tremendous open source community
					</h3>
					<p>
						Unlike many other systems out there, git truly has no limit. As a free user, one is able to host an unlimited amount of pages on the web, as well as a limitless amount of public repositories. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The benefits of using git lie not only in the ability to host sites for free or store code online, but in the community of individuals who volunteer countless hours improving code for others. Via pull requests, organizations, and more, git (and github) allow you to enter into a collaborative and self-sustaining community.

					<h3>
						What does cloning mean?
					</h3>
					<p>
						When using Git, cloning refers to downloading the entire contents of a repository on to one's personal computer. Unlike other version control systems, Git allows you or anyone else who so desires to download the entire repository.
					</p>
					<p>
						This, of course, has several notable benefits. As Git is built around the idea of open source code, anyone in the world is able to clone a repository and help the owner fix mistakes and produce better products.

					<h3>
						Local repositories and git
					</h3>
					<p>
						Compared to other competing version control systems, git differs in a few minor ways. Among these differences is the way git handles locally stored snippets of code- there exists a clear dinstinction between local and remote code.
					</p>
					<p>
					When you clone an online repository, you are creating a local copy of all files contained in the repository. The significance in this is realizing the distinction- and from that understanding how to properly manage a locally store repo. As a result of this structure, it is essential to keep your local copy up to date at all times so that it can be easily pushed back up to the online repository. The way to make sure of this is to execute the command <strong>git pull</strong> from the command line.

						If you wish to pick on this easily, it is absolutely essential to keep in mind what is actually going on rather than mindelessly typing in commands. That said, let us continue  onward with a brief explanation of the commands one must know in order to push from the command line.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="commandslist">
					<p>git status: Git status is a quick and easy way to understand what state your local repository is in as compared to the online repository</p>
					<p>git add: Git add includes a file in the staging area, so that it can be commited</p>
					<p>git commit: Git commit takes a "snapshot" of the repository in the condition that it is in</p>
					<p>git push: Git push transfers all commits and changes to the online repository</p>
